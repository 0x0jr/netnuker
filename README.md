`netnuker` is an all in-one attack tool which can do: `TCP Syn Flood Attacks, Nmap scans, Sub Directory Brute Forcing`

`netnuker` uses `nmap` and a custom tool I wrote named `subdestroyer` for recon.

You can install the dependencies with the requirements.txt file: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

Note: You can implement ip spoofing for TCP Syn Flooding but this tool just spoofs the source port.
